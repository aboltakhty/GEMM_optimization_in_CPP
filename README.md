# GEMM_optimization_in_CPP

1) Python: Initialize the matrices with a constant seed (4x4, 8x8, 16x16, and so on) and alpha beta constants just like gemm
2) Python: Start the timer and pass these values and matrices to C++ code
3) C++: Do the multiplication just like with and without optimiation (finally if it possible add openmp)
4) Python: Stop the timer and store the time value
